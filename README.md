# Administrative Arrangement Orders ontology

This is an [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) ontology that models the elements within the Australian Government's 
Administrative Arrangement Orders (AAOs). 

This ontology was creating working backwards from aAO instance data with the data taken from the 
[National Archives of Australia](http://www.naa.gov.au)'s 
[listing of them](http://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-governance/aao/index.aspx).

AAOs are authoritatively listed at [legislation.gov.au](https://www.legislation.gov.au) here: 
<https://www.legislation.gov.au/Browse/ByRegDate/AdministrativeArrangementsOrders/>.
